#####README######
We used the structural SVM software (with cutting plane algorithm) created by Thorsten Joachims. We used the API to implement our learning algorithm.

Files in this folder:

nba_player_pair.m is the implementation of our algorithm. It takes training set and testing set as input and returns the final prediction accuracy.

cross_validation.m is our implmentation of 3-fold cross validation. 

Please note: these two files are written by ourselves and the rest is part of the software.

dataset2.mat is the dataset that has 18 features for each player and is not too informative. (The first column of the cell team_players is the data that we used. The second column is used to store the information for manually checking player's personal information and please ignore this column.)

####How to Run the program######
First make sure the toolbox is compiled.

To compile the code, you will need MATLAB and a C compiler (typical Xcode under Mac, and GCC under Linux, and Visual C under Windows). On Mac and Linux, assuming that MATLAB mex command is available on the command line search path, the following command should compile the MEX file implementing the wrapper:

$ make

In windows, please type command in MATLAB command line:
 makefile_windows

Then change the matfile name to change the dataset, and change the string of parameters indicates in : http://www.cs.cornell.edu/People/tj/svm_light/svm_struct.html
